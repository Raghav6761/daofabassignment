# Daofabassignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.3.

## Project Assumptions

The following assumptions have been made in the implementation of the project:

1. Data Format : The data we are dealing with from the backend is completely based on JSON and any deviation from the structure provided 'Parent.json' and 'Child.json' can lead to error(s).

2. Single Page Application: The application is designed as a single page application (SPA) using Angular routing. Navigation between the parent table and child details page is handled within the SPA without a full page refresh.

3. UI/UX Design: The focus of this assignment is on functionality rather than extensive UI/UX design. The styling and layout of the components may be kept minimal for simplicity.

4. Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented, assuming that error messages will be displayed in the console for debugging purposes. Error handling for production-level applications may require additional implementation.

5. Unit Tests: Unit tests for the components, services, and APIs are not within the scope of this assignment. However, it is encouraged to write tests for these components and services to ensure proper functionality.

6. While I was expected to add server side pagination. I could not implement the same due to shortage of time and clash of commitments on my end and apologize for the same. If required and possible, please allow me more time to work and build the same.

7. Normally, the end users is sent the production complete code and not the development. So, if you would like to view that please do let me know and I can send that as well. 

That's all from my side, Cheers !!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
